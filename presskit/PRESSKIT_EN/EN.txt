= History:

I am a person who has been fascinated with the game development process from an early age.
On my account I have some small production but never published them. In January 2017 launched 
the idea of creating a game for mobile devices. It is my first major production in which 
I invested my time and money, and the first serious production that I managed to finish and from 
I am serious satisfied. This game initially i was available in google play the version beta, 
this allowed me to get to know the opinions from around the world. Feedback allowed me to 
refine my game. Thanks to that the game is good in every respect.
